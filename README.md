# Azure-PaaS-ChefClient

##Overview
What is the **Azure PaaS/Chef Client bootstrapper**?

The Chef PaaS client was built out of a need to quickly establish a Chef client on a Azure PaaS Role. With this project, you can now easy create a Chef node on a PaaS role as easy as adding a Web or Worker Role and including the NuGet package that this generated from this project. 

You can also search [Nuget.Org -- To be Released](http://www.nuget.org/packages/) for the latest released package or you can clone the project source here.


##Using the Azure PaaS Chef Client

##Project Contents
The contents of this project is maintained in two dependent PowerShell Modules, the breakdown of the project:

- Core - module entry point scripts
- Modules
	- InstallationSDK.AzureServiceRuntime (PowerShell Module:Azure Service runtime wrapper) 
	- InstallationSDK.ChefClientInstaller (PowerShell Module:Configuration and Installation of the Chef Client)
		- code - .Net c# files
		- resource - place holder for adding the [Chef Client msi](http://www.opscode.com/chef/install.msi)
		- script - main PowerShell script for configuring the Chef Client
- NuGet - NuGet specifications for the two Module Packages

###Creating the Packages
To create the client NuGet package(s), [clone](github-windows://openRepo/https://github.com/Microsoft/Azure-PaaS-ChefClient) or [download](https://github.com/Microsoft/Azure-PaaS-ChefClient/archive/merge-code.zip) the project repository.

Using NuGet.exe, open a command window and navigate to the NuGet folder.

For example, my repositories are located in: 
```
c:\github\
```

Create the core package: 
```
C:\github\Azure-PaaS-ChefClient\nuget>nuget pack InstallationSDK.nuspec
```

Create the client installer package:
```
C:\github\Azure-PaaS-ChefClient\nuget>nuget pack InstallationSDK.ChefClientInstaller.nuspec
```

Now you have a local copy of the NuGet packages and can add them to your Cloud Service project in Visual Studio.

###Add to Cloud Service
Create a simple Cloud Service, add an empty Web Role, and open via solution context menu, 'Manage NuGet Packages for Solution'.

Configured for local package sources (where your newly packages reside), click 'install' to add the ChefClient package and select the WebRole that you wish to add it to. This will add both Chef Client and dependent Core packages to your solution package cache and project. 

Your web role will now contain the two code (.cs) files and a deployment folder with the configuration, script, and two PowerShell Modules.

####OnStart
In your RolEntryPoint.OnStart() method you need to start the chef-client windows service.

```csharp
ClientService.Start()

or 

ClientService.Start(TimeSpan)
```

####OnStop
In your RolEntryPoint.OnStop() method you need to stop the chef-client windows service.

```csharp
ClientService.Stop()

or 

ClientService.Stop(TimeSpan, boolean)
```

###Configuration
There are two configuration paths to take, from config.json or directly in your cloud service configuration (.cscfg) file. They are limited based on the current functionlity of the (script) main.ps1, but can be extended (read further below in *Extending*).
####config.json
```json
{
  "name": "node_name_prefix",
  "role": "role_name",
  "pollInterval": "120",
  "serverUrl": "https://chefsvr-url/organizations/org_name",
  "sslVerifyMode": ":verify_none",
  "validationClientName": "validator-name",
  "validationKey": "validator-name.pem"
}
```

####cloudService.cscfg
```xml
<Role name="AzureRoleName">
<Instances count="1" />
<ConfigurationSettings>
  <Setting name="ChefClient_ServerUrl" value="https://chefsvr-ha.cloudapp.net/organizations/msn" />
  <Setting name="ChefClient_EncryptedDataBagSecret" value="" />
  <Setting name="ChefClient_ServerUrl" value="" />
  <Setting name="ChefClient_Role" value="" />
  <Setting name="ChefClient_Environment" value="" />
  <Setting name="ChefClient_Region" value="" />
  <Setting name="ChefClient_Function" value="" />
  <Setting name="ChefClient_ServiceName" value="" />
</ConfigurationSettings>
</Role>
TBA
```

##Data available to your recipes
Written to the Node at #[Node][Azure] are the following data elements and configured details, not limited to:
~~~ruby
deployment.id
update_domain
instance_id
fault_domain
instance_endpoints

chef_environment
chef_role
region
function
service_name
~~~

The last five, come directly from your configured service deployment allowing to pass from azure role to Chef Node.


###Extending
The ./deployment/script file [main.ps1]() can be altered in this location to meet your *more specific* needs if necessary, utilizing the Modules exported functions or additional ones you add to your project.
